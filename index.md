The Cyber Defense Framework addresses the various challenges and key requirements to secure your IT Infrastructures against emerging Cyber Threats. Based on 5 domains, the controls set out clear expectations to evaluate the maturity to be in place at the Cyber Defense Center or Security Operation Center to protect their organization.

This can be extremely handy for the organizations as well that have outsourced the related functions to thirdparties and need to ensure if they really have them covered.

Stay tuned, more information coming soon...
