The Cyber Defense Framework (CDF) addresses various challenges and key requirements to secure your IT infrastructure against emerging Cyber Threats. Based on 5 domains, the controls set out clear expectations to evaluate the maturity to be in place at the Cyber Defense Center or Security Operation Center to protect their organization. CDF will play a vital role at organizations in designing a comprehensive Roadmap.

This can be extremely handy for the organizations as well that have outsourced the related functions to third parties and need to ensure if they really have them covered.


Stay tuned, more information coming soon...
